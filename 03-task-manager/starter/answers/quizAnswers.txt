Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
  In an Express application, middleware is a function that takes three arguments: a request object, a response object and the next function.
  But there are also those that take four arguments for error handling.
  We have three options when it comes to middleware, using built-in middleware, our custom-made ones or those written by other developers.
  Express allows us to use the middleware through the function/method app.use().
What does CRUD stand for?
  CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. These are the actions that we can perform(ed) on our data.
You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
  We are able to access the information in the .env file by using the environment variable process.env.<yourVariableName>
  Environment variables are predetermined values that are typically used to provide the ability to configure a value in your code 
  from outside of your application.
  It is important to create the .env file at your root directory, else you might not be able to access your variable(s).
How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
  We are able to protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in our github repository by listing it on our gitignore file 
  before pushing our code to github.
